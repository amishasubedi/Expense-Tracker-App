how to make components resusable?
copy and paste the line in App.js 
To convert date into human readable form, use .toLocaleString();

props - object that stores the value of attributes of tag and work similar to the HTML.
      - gives a way to pass data from one component to other components

      function Alu (props) - props passed in function (same way as arguments passed in function)


multiple components - splitting task into smaller projects
Since, we need to style date seperately, it will be easier to split ExpenseItem into 2 components.
    1. ExpenseItem class iteself
    2. Date

Card - container look

Alternative way of writing function: -> use arrow function (JS thing)

for instance:

        const App = () => {
            // 
        }

Function and Class Components

function Check (props) {
    return <h1> k cha, {props.name} </h1>
}

This function accepts a single props (which basically stands for properties)
object argument with data and returns a React element, they are called function
components as they are js functions.


React State and Working with Events:
    - User Interaction
       -> handling Events
    - updating UI and working with "State"
    - Components and State

 1. Listening to events and working with event handlers
 In React, we add event listener by going to the JSX element, and there we add a special prop.
 <button onCLick = {function click() {console.log("ok")}}> Change button </button>

 A function should be passed as a value for onClick

2. How component functions are executed
